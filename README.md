# Classifying Emotions of Labeled Spotify Songs for Improved Music Recommendation
Epitech Summer Program 2023 Project 2

## Outline  
1. Introduction
2. Background
3. Data Collection and Preprocessing
4. Define and Fit models (SVM, KNN)
5. Performance Results
6. Conclusion

## Introduction  
- Usually, music recommend music depending on artist and genre.
However, by using data that labeled 4 types of emotion to 278,000 songs,
music could be recommended also considering the emotions. This way,
user satisfaction will get improved, and will eventually increase loyalty to
the service.  

- In this project, we will train and evaluate the performance of models on
the emotion labeled Spotify Songs dataset in order to contribute in
better recommendation afterwards
